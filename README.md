# Signals and Fourier transform
Toy implementations of discrete fourier transform algorithms, both in a naive and a fast way.

Todo-list:
- [x] Naive Fourier transform algorithm
- [ ] Fast Fourier transform algorithm
- [x] Plots using [plotlib](https://docs.rs/plotlib/latest/plotlib/)
- [ ] Replace plotlib with a library allowing to draw continuous graphs from discrete set of points
